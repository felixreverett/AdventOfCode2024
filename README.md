### What have I learnt about JavaScript
- Using forEach (e.g. `Array.forEach(i => { /*code*/ })`) for efficiently iterating through arrays (see day 8, 10)

### What have I learnt about Go
- Go has no ternary operators 😬
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are a way to cleanly process an input through multiple functions without nesting functions (verbose) or method chaining (not supported in Go).
